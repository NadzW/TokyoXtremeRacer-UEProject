# Reccomended Setup

1. [Fork](https://github.com/NadzW/TokyoXtremeRacer-UEProject/fork) the main branch of this repository.
2. Whenever this main branch updates, simply pull the commits from main into your fork.

There is also an [Asset Gen](https://github.com/NadzW/TokyoXtremeRacer-UEProject/tree/Asset-Gen) branch of the project that has many Data Tables, Data Assets, String Tables, Enums and Structs that have been generated with [JsonAsAsset](https://github.com/JsonAsAsset/JsonAsAsset). Due to many missing assets (textures, meshes, sounds, blueprints and other asset types that may be referenced in these), it is reccomended to double check any of these and or regenerate the assets after importing those missing assets. You can migrate assets from this branch as you need.
