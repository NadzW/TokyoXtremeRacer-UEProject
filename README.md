A UE5.6.1 Project generated to make mods for [Tokyo Xtreme Racer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2634950/Tokyo_Xtreme_Racer/)

Many Data Tables, Data Assets, String Tables, Enums and Structs have been generated with JAA. Due to many missing assets (textures, meshes, sounds and other asset types that may be referenced in these), it is reccomended to double check any of these and or regenerate the assets after importing those missing assets.
